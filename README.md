# refractored-password-generator

## Description

For my third challenge in the coding bootcamp, I was required to refractor code in JavaScript for a password generator. I had to make sure they were prompted for a password length that was between 8-120 characters, and were also asked for the criteria(s) of their password. Then to also prevent the site from freezing I had to make sure they selected at least 1 criteria.
